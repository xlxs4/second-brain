#### Introduction

Greetings! I'm Orestis, I come from Greece and I'm the co-science lead in the AcubeSAT project.
AcubeSAT is a project of a student team called SpaceDot and is part of the Fly Your Satellite 3! program.
I've been involved in this effort since almost the very beginnings, when everything was still at a nascent stage.
I'm currently getting to wrap up my studies, and I've joined the team not long after I enrolled in the university, I've worked in different aspects of the project, technical and not, and now I'm responsible for the Science-y stuff.

The AcubeSAT nanosatellite undertaking began late 2018 - 2019.
We've designed and are developing a 3U CubeSat which holds a 2U biology payload.
Our mission is two-fold: we want to establish our idea for a modular platform to perform space biology experiments in CubeSats/small satellites as a working prototype.
Also, we aim to probe the way conditions in LEO (mainly microgravity and cosmic radiation) affect yeast cells at the gene expression level.
To achieve that, the 2U payload is a pressurized vessel which hosts a container with the various compartments to run our experiments.
We'll culture cells in-orbit and then see how their gene expression is altered through acquiring images via our DIY microscope-like imaging system.
We aim to run the same experiment in three distinct timepoints across the duration of our mission, and to do this we've been using a small platform called a LoC to hold the cells and interface them with the various fluidics in a miniaturized version of a biology lab; but more on that at the end.

In brief, we've submitted our proposal in October 2019, took part in the selection workshop hosted here in December 2019, got accepted in February 2020, submitted the TS-VCD (requirements) in April, submitted the first version of CDR in October and had it approved in September 2021, marking the end of the design phase and the beginning of the construction/testing phase.
Right now we are getting ready to run a series of testing campaigns at the ESA facilities, then pass the MRR and be in-orbit by late 2023/early 2024.

#### Context

Before getting on with the actual presentation, I feel the need to underline the overall surrounding context regarding the team I've been and am a part of and the general environment in which we've been undertaking the FYS! journey.
Maybe some of these will align with the environment and the challenges you are to face, maybe not.
1) There's no significant activity in the Aerospace sector in Greece, with the exception of some little companies and organizations that are trying to kickstart things, but we're still at a very early stage
2) On a similar manner, there's not much related expertise or a degree (e.g. in Aerospace engineering) to be offered in Greek universities. These mean it's difficult to get financial or technical support for the project
3) Student's don't gain ECTS credits etc. for being involved in the project to count towards completing a degree. People usually don't get to work at something space-related afterwards, at least in Greece, most enter the team stay for 1 - 1.5 year and then leave

#### Presentation scope

The presentation is focused on discussing some of the programmatic aspects of the challenges you might come to face as FYS! progresses, rather than getting into the nitty gritty things on the technical side. TODO: more

#### Presentation Structure

The presentation is split into topics that fall mainly into two distinct categories, the first being project management, while the second follows a more people-centric narrative. There will be advice with an emphasis on the earlier stages of the project, and some good and... not that good decisions to make or avoid, respectively. I'll try cast a more personal light and share some hurdles we've faced and had to overcome, or that we are still facing to this day. Following that tangent, I'll briefly go over some particular examples that greatly affected our team. Then, I'll mention some additional tips, and will close the presentation with an addendum on trying to realize a mission carrying a biological payload, since I've been informed there are some teams interested in working towards that. Because this is somewhat of a niche, please feel free to come have a chat with me after the Q&A session is over, so that we can talk in more detail. I'll share some handles and ways you can reach out to me, I and the whole team are very open and eager to discuss and chime in in whichever way possible.
