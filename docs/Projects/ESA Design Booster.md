- you have to develop skillset from zero
- almost everything is behind closed doors, you don't even know what's out there, you have to learn but how?
- you have to find support (e.g. from university)
- you have to ensure infrastructure (e.g. machines)
- try maintain information transfer at all costs
- it's a demanding project without rewards (monetary, ECTS...) - how do you get people to do volunteering work?
- there's no leadership voice outside of the team, the organization has to be DIY
- what do you do when exams are around the corner?
- COVID hit, and it hit hard. Why?
- invest in open-source and the community. There's people you can learn from, if not teach
- you'll eventually have to scale up, time and time again. How?
- taking initiatives is vital, how do you find someone to do the boring work? How do you get ordinary people to do the extraordinary?
- be afraid of the [bus factor](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Bus_factor). But also always remember: NO ONE is irreplaceable
- you need SYE, aka systems overview: for management, always see the forest, not the tree
- you need HR
- how do you ensure meeting participation?
- always be wary of cross-dependencies
- remember, everything's gonna be alright
- if it isn't, not to worry. It's an educational program
- you got help from ESA, experts (esp. the experts), reach out
- talk with the FYS people a looot
- find good infrastructure, platforms, esp. for organization. Get people involved
- communicate problems (to ESA too ;))
- it's a marathon, not a sprint
- (... but there will be sprints)
- set up a "core" team of people to serve as the backbone of the team at all times
- who thinks about the team and not just technical work or events?
- ALWAYS face your problems, always speak, always communicate
- more often than not, there's a bigger underlying problem, and it has to do with structure. People are usually not the source of the problem
- but people CAN be the source of the problem. Never underestimate that. Especially if they are in a position of power, either organizationally or due to technical expertise
- this is a very long-term project, it therefore transcends individuals
- people won't do things they don't want to do forever
- there's always someone out there that wants to work on what you don't. Find them
- have a plan B, C, D, ...
- decisions will always upset some people. The question is which
- invest in those you believe will carry the team forward, not from a technical viewpoint
- ... this might mean not going with the majority. The majority will also blindly follow whatever, it's a formless mass to give shape to
- physical presence is vital
- expand beyond the scope of the project, hang out, do cool things on the side
- constantly track things, move deadlines appropriately, be on top of things
- be agile, especially in the beginning. Find what's good for you. Understand *why* it's good for you
- you'll fuck up, constantly. Relax and learn from it
- try to build a momentum, then ride it, but guide it too; don't let it carry you
- GitLab is necessary
- hold concurrent sessions, frequent meetings, be transparent always
- involve people and throw problems at them (but always be there when needed)
- understand, mitigate but ultimately just be okay with the [Pareto principle](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pareto_principle)
- who gets credits? for what? is their work recognized?
- so much miscommunication and misunderstandings
- be calm, diffuse situations, avoid crowd mentality
- always find the next gen, preemptively
- sometimes you have to be quick to arrive at a decision. That might mean you won't have time to get everyone to agree with said decision
- keep minutes, have agendas, don't recycle topics, end each topic with an action, make the most out of a meeting
- don't leave anyone on their own
- set group tasks
- feedback is crucial, it's all about feedback cycles
- the project requires heavy investment. This means it will overlap with other areas of the members' lives. You have to take that into account and learn about other areas of their life in order to effectively support them
- there's always exceptions to rules. Understand the rules, then break them
- it's better for someone to work on something mid priority that they love, than the opposite
- give people things they might not love but that are important, and things that aren't important but they love doing
- recruitment is key. You'll also need to establish presence in the uni(s) to get people in REC
- set small, well-defined tasks. Make the members feel and visualize the progress
- make sure everyone is on the same page regarding the high-level roadmap
- don't make someone coo lightly (i.e. don't endow with power lightly)
- progress is seldom linear, or apparent. Try to make it apparent, but have that in mind
- praise in public blame in private (not always)
- cross-team meetings are very important
- other teams participate in FYS!

#### Introduction

Greetings! I'm Orestis, I come from Greece and I'm the co-science lead in the AcubeSAT project.
AcubeSAT is a project of a student team called SpaceDot and is part of the Fly Your Satellite 3! program.
I've been involved in this effort since almost the very beginnings, when everything was still at a nascent stage.
I'm currently getting to wrap up my studies, and I've joined the team not long after I enrolled in the university, I've worked in different aspects of the project, technical and not, and now I'm responsible for the Science-y stuff.

The AcubeSAT nanosatellite undertaking began late 2018 - 2019.
We've designed and are developing a 3U CubeSat which holds a 2U biology payload.
Our mission is two-fold: we want to establish our idea for a modular platform to perform space biology experiments in CubeSats/small satellites as a working prototype.
Also, we aim to probe the way conditions in LEO (mainly microgravity and cosmic radiation) affect yeast cells at the gene expression level.
To achieve that, the 2U payload is a pressurized vessel which hosts a container with the various compartments to run our experiments.
We'll culture cells in-orbit and then see how their gene expression is altered through acquiring images via our DIY microscope-like imaging system.
We aim to run the same experiment in three distinct timepoints across the duration of our mission, and to do this we've been using a small platform called a LoC to hold the cells and interface them with the various fluidics in a miniaturized version of a biology lab; but more on that at the end.
TODO: high-level timeline and current status overview.

#### Context

Before getting on with the actual presentation, I feel the need to underline the overall surrounding context regarding the team I've been and am a part of and the general environment in which we've been undertaking the FYS! journey.
TODO: 1) no aerospace stuff/expertise in Greece 2) no expertise or degree in uni 3) no ECTS credits etc., purely volunteer work αρα no strong motives, people don't get to even work at something space-related afterwards, most enter the team, stay for ~1.5 year and then leave. Also no support

#### Presentation scope

The presentation is focused on discussing some of the programmatic aspects of the challenges you might come to face as FYS! progresses, rather than getting into the nitty gritty things on the technical side. TODO: more

#### Presentation Structure

The presentation is split into topics that fall mainly into two distinct categories, the first being project management, while the second follows a more people-centric narrative. There will be advice with an emphasis on the earlier stages of the project, and some good and... not that good decisions to make or avoid, respectively. I'll to cast a more personal light and share some hurdles we've faced and had to overcome, or that we are still facing to this day. Following that tangent, I'll briefly go over some particular examples that greatly affected our team. Then, I'll mention some additional tips, and will close the presentation with an addendum on trying to realize a mission carrying a biological payload, since I've been informed there are some teams interested in working towards that. Because this is somewhat of a niche, please feel free to come have a chat after the Q&A session is over, in more detail. I'll share some handles and ways you can reach out to me, I and the whole team are very open and eager to discuss and chime in in whichever way possible.
