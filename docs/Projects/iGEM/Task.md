### Solution

Developing a biodegradable alternative to plastic-based fishing nets by **creating a protein-based fiber** that is designed to be adapted for marine environments. Designs are based on the strongest fibers found in nature, through optimizing and producing different **silk proteins** as well as a fiber protein found in **sea anemone**. Also produced a marine spider silk protein. To further improve the strength of the fiber and make it water-resistant, we are coating them with a protective layer of mussel foot proteins, a protective protein found in the outer layer of the marine fiber byssus, which is produced in clams. This coating is achieved through the SnoopTag/Catcher system, which enables linkage between proteins.

The core of the biomaterial is made of spider silk, which gives the net elasticity and high tensile strength. To make this, we produced minispidroin proteins which can be spun to form the core fiber.We are then coating the spider silk in the sticky and protective protein called Mussel foot protein. To link the first and second layer we utilized the SnoopTag/Catcher system, and orthogonal protein conjugation systems can be used to add more layers to further functionalize the fiber. Further, for the core fiber, we designed and successfully expressed a completely novel and first of its kind chimeric marine-minispidroin spider silk protein called MAKI. We also successfully expressed aneroin, an anemone silk protein that is completely new to iGEM.

involving silk proteins in the core of our fiber is an approach more likely to carry success, as it has incredible tensile strength and elasticity. Silks are a unique type of fiber in which proteins with highly repetitive motifs can align after folding into a specific conformation. Spider silk proteins have multiple repetitive regions that are characterized by alternating glycine-rich and alanine-rich regions. The former form amorphous regions, while the latter are dominated by alpha helices. Shear force, dehydration and salt exchanges. allow the silk proteins to refold into conformations dominated by beta-sheets, which among others, gives incredible strength to the fiber. The amorphous regions are responsible for the elasticity of the fiber. We decided to use minispidroin, a recombinant hybrid silk protein that has been optimized for fiber spinning.

We decided to use the silks of spiders living in aquatic environments, e.g., _Desis marina_ and _Argyroneta aquatica_ as inspiration for the core of our fiber. Here, we used fragments of sequences from different terrestrial and marine spider silk proteins, to design and successfully express the completely new and never seen before chimeric spider silk protein, MAKI marine minispidroin. Further, we also successfully produced aneroin, an anemone silk protein that is completely new to iGEM.

mussels produce a fiber called byssus in which a collagen core is protected by proteins. These proteins are called mussel foot proteins and they act as a very strong interconnected protective layer. They are rich in the amino acid tyrosine, and when an enzyme called tyrosinase oxidizes tyrosine, it forms a very sticky compound called DOPA. Finally, if DOPA is oxidized again, it forms quinones, which could help to make our nets resistant to bacterial degradation

the mussel foot proteins, with DOPA groups, can act as a kind of glue to coat our fibers, in order to slow the rate of degradation of our fishing nets. To achieve a more specific binding of the mussel foot protein to our silk core fiber, we incorporate a lock and key mechanism which would ensure that the protective proteins would better adhere to the surface of our fiber. This lock and key mechanism is called SnoopTag-SnoopCatcher, and we use it by fusing the catcher (lock) to the mussel foot proteins and the tag (key) to the spider silk proteins.

The resulting fiber has a very refined structure, with a silk core and a lock and key system that binds the mussel foot protein together. Additionally this lock-and-key system can serve as a platform for attaching almost any protein to the fiber. In our case, functions such as an early detection system to warn fishers of bycatch, or bioluminescence for repellence of endangered animals, such as dolphins and turtles, could be incorporated, provided that the appropriate detection or bioluminescence module is developed and attached. This opens for a whole world of sustainable possibilities for the fishing industry, which advocates for the conservation and preservation of the oceans and the species that inhabit them.

Problem: nets get lost -> nets kill marine animals, damage coral reefs
-> also microplastics, big problem because there's a ton of nets, will persist long-term
