## Problem

### Fishing nets pose a great threat on many levels

More than **25 000 nets** are lost each year in the North-East Atlantic Ocean alone. These lost nets are known as **ghost nets** as they can haunt the oceans by continuing to catch fish when lost by the fishermen. Studies show that they are among the most harmful marine debris and it is estimated that they cause the **deaths of hundreds of thousands of marine animals** each year, including protected species, such as dolphins, whales and turtles. Currently, **46%** of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch by weight consists of ghost nets which accounts for an area **three times the size of France**.

### What will happen if we do not act?

If left unresolved, the plastic pollution in the oceans will keep contributing to the accumulation of plastics such as that observed in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch will keep growing. It takes **600-800** years to fully degrade a nylon net, this means that the current lost nets will keep affecting the ocean for many more years. **Thus immediate action is essential!** Additionally, a huge unspoken danger is posed by the fragmentation of the nets in the ocean, which results in the release of **microplastics** and contributes to its accumulation in the food chains. This includes ourselves. Microplastics have been recently shown to accumulate in our blood and also in animalsâ€™ brains. Therefore, the threat posed by non-biodegradable fishing nets to the environment is multifaceted, urgent and perilous.

"Current fishing nets are a huge source of pollution and damage to marine environments. Nets are frequently lost and yet continue to roam the oceans, endangering many species and ecosystems in its way. Furthermore, they also serve as a major contributor to microplastic emission in the oceans. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find an alternative for plastic-based fishing nets to overcome this global issue."

"Up until the early 1960s, cotton and Manila hemp, were commonly used as natural materials for fishing nets. Synthetic fibers, such as nylon made of polyamide (PA), replaced these materials after World War II, given that these materials were not only of high strength and flexibility, which resulted in good fishing performance and durability, but also of low price and good processability. However, it would be found later that nylon takes 600-800 years to degrade."

"Biodegradable alternatives to such nets have appeared recently. For instance, nets using biodegradable resins which are degraded by bacteria or fungi in sea water. However, these nets cannot compete with the plastic-based ones. Other alternatives such as the ones proposed by SEALIVE, which used green materials like micro-algae or other biobased materials are under development. This means that more work is still required in the field in order to obtain biodegradable nets with the same, or better, fishing properties than the ones that are currently in use."

### Solution

We are developing a biodegradable alternative to plastic-based fishing nets by **creating a protein-based fiber** that is designed to be adapted for marine environments. This is the **first ever SynBio approach** to tackle the issue of ghost fishing and marine plastic pollution from fishing nets. We have based our designs on the strongest fibers found in nature, by optimizing and producing different **silk proteins** as well as a fiber protein found in **sea anemone**. We are also the first to ever produce a marine spider silk protein! To further improve the strength of the fiber and make it water-resistant, we are coating them with a protective layer of mussel foot proteins, a protective protein found in the outer layer of the marine fiber byssus, which is produced in clams. This coating is achieved through the SnoopTag/Catcher system, which enables linkage between proteins. Thereby we are making a strong, but still biodegradable fiber, which does not cause microplastic pollution, that can be used as a sustainable material for fishing net production.

at Netlantis, we are developing a novel biomaterial based on a multilayered protein fiber that can be a biodegradable alternative to plastic for making fishing nets.

The core of the biomaterial is made of spider silk, which gives the net elasticity and high tensile strength. To make this, we produced minispidroin proteins which can be spun to form the core fiber. To protect this fiber from the harsh marine environment that it is meant to be implemented in, we are coating the spider silk in the sticky and protective protein: Mussel foot Protein. To link the first and second layer we utilized the SnoopTag/Catcher system, and orthogonal protein conjugation systems can be used to add more layers to further functionalize the fiber. Further, for the core fiber, we designed and successfully expressed a completely novel and first of its kind chimeric marine-minispidroin spider silk protein called MAKI. We also successfully expressed aneroin, an anemone silk protein that is completely new to iGEM.

involving silk proteins in the core of our fiber is an approach more likely to carry success, as it has incredible tensile strength and elasticity. Fishermen in remote areas of the world have even been observed to use natural spider silk to catch fish in shallow waters14. Silks are a unique type of fiber in which proteins with highly repetitive motifs can align after folding into a specific conformation. Spider silk proteins have multiple repetitive regions that are characterized by alternating glycine-rich and alanine-rich regions. The former form amorphous regions, while the latter are dominated by alpha helices. In the silk-producing organ of the spider, called the spinneret, proteins are concentrated, subjected to shear force, dehydration, and salt exchanges. This allows the silk proteins to refold into conformations dominated by beta-sheets, which among others, gives incredible strength to the fiber. In contrast to this, the amorphous regions are responsible for the elasticity of the fiber. Interestingly, spiders use different silk proteins in different situations. This allows them to make a fiber that suits a very specific purpose, like catching prey, forming cocoons or constructing the backbone of its cob-webs15. For our project, we decided to use minispidroin, a recombinant hybrid silk protein that has been optimized for fiber spinning.

we decided to use the silks of spiders living in aquatic environments, e.g., _Desis marina_ and _Argyroneta aquatica_ as inspiration for the core of our fiber. Here, we used fragments of sequences from different terrestrial and marine spider silk proteins, to design and successfully express the completely new and never seen before chimeric spider silk protein, MAKI marine minispidroin. Further, we also successfully produced aneroin, an anemone silk protein that is completely new to iGEM.

mussels produce a fiber called byssus in which a collagen core is protected by proteins. These proteins are called mussel foot proteins and they act as a very strong interconnected protective layer. They are rich in the amino acid tyrosine, and when an enzyme called tyrosinase oxidizes tyrosine, it forms a very sticky compound called DOPA. Finally, if DOPA is oxidized again, it forms quinones, which could help to make our nets resistant to bacterial degradation

the mussel foot proteins, with DOPA groups, can act as a kind of glue to coat our fibers, in order to slow the rate of degradation of our fishing nets. Following this finding, we decided to go even further and attempt to achieve a more specific binding of the mussel foot protein to our silk core fiber, by incorporating a lock and key mechanism which would ensure that the protective proteins would better adhere to the surface of our fiber. This lock and key mechanism is called SnoopTag-SnoopCatcher, and we use it by fusing the catcher (lock) to the mussel foot proteins and the tag (key) to the spider silk proteins.

Problem: nets get lost -> nets kill marine animals, damage coral reefs
-> also microplastics, big problem because there's a ton of nets, will persist long-term
