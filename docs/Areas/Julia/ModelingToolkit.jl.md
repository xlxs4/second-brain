ModelingToolkit.jl is a modeling language. It can do both symbolic and numeric computation. It is highly performant and parallel. It is extendable because it brings ideas from symbolic CAS and causal/acausal equation-based modeling frameworks. The model can be input as a high-level description. Then, the model is analyzed and enhanced through symbolic preprocessing. It allows for automatic transformations, such as index reduction, to be applied before solving in order to easily handle equations that could not have been solved without symbolic intervention.
