  {"id":"ajo-franklinRationalDesignMemory2007","abstract":"The ability to logically engineer novel cellular functions promises a deeper understanding of biological systems. Here we demonstrate the rational design of cellular memory in yeast that employs autoregulatory transcriptional positive feedback. We built a set of transcriptional activators and quantitatively characterized their effects on gene expression in living cells. Modeling in conjunction with the quantitative characterization of the activator-promoter pairs accurately predicts the behavior of the memory network. This study demonstrates the power of taking advantage of components with measured quantitative parameters to specify eukaryotic regulatory networks with desired properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Ajo-Franklin","given":"Caroline M."},{"family":"Drubin","given":"David A."},{"family":"Eskin","given":"Julian A."},{"family":"Gee","given":"Elaine P.S."},{"family":"Landgraf","given":"Dirk"},{"family":"Phillips","given":"Ira"},{"family":"Silver","given":"Pamela A."}],"citation-key":"ajo-franklinRationalDesignMemory2007","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.1586107","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"18","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,9,15]]},"language":"en","page":"2271-2276","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Rational design of memory in eukaryotic cells","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/gad.1586107","volume":"21"},

  {"id":"astromFeedbackSystemsIntroduction2021","abstract":"\"In this updated and revised edition of the classic Feedback Systems (which Princeton University Press first published in 2008), Astrom and Murray provide a complete one-volume resource for students and researchers in mathematics and engineering. One of the primary comments from users of the first edition was that the use of control tools for design purposes occurred only after several chapters of analytical tools, leaving the instructor having to try to convince students that the techniques would soon be useful. Accordingly, the authors have re-structured the text to introduce design principles upfront. The text also includes a new chapter on fundamental limits, as well as additional updated material throughout. Drawing on examples from physics, computer science, and operations research, and more to introduce the basic principles and tools of feedback systems, the second edition of Feedback Systems will continue to serve as the ideal textbook for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as an indispensable reference for researchers\"--","author":[{"family":"Åström","given":"Karl Johan"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Richard M."}],"citation-key":"astromFeedbackSystemsIntroduction2021","edition":"Second edition","event-place":"Princeton","ISBN":"978-0-691-19398-4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"publisher":"Princeton University Press","publisher-place":"Princeton","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Feedback systems: an introduction for scientists and engineers","title-short":"Feedback systems","type":"book"},
  {"id":"burrillSyntheticCircuitIdentifies2011","abstract":"Differential responses to stimuli can affect how cells succumb to disease. In yeast, DNA damage can create heterogeneous responses. To delineate how a response contributes to a cell's future behavior, we constructed a transcription-based memory circuit that detects DNA repair to isolate subpopulations with heritable damage responses. Strongly responsive cells show multigenerational effects, including growth defects and iron-associated gene expression. Less-responsive cells exhibit increased mutation frequencies but resume wild-type behavior. These two subpopulations remain distinct for multiple generations, indicating a transmissible memory of damage. Collectively, this work demonstrates the efficacy of using synthetic biology to define how environmental exposure contributes to distinct cell fates.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Burrill","given":"Devin R."},{"family":"Silver","given":"Pamela A."}],"citation-key":"burrillSyntheticCircuitIdentifies2011","container-title":"Genes & Development","container-title-short":"Genes Dev.","DOI":"10.1101/gad.1994911","ISSN":"0890-9369, 1549-5477","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,3,1]]},"language":"en","page":"434-439","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Synthetic circuit identifies subpopulations with sustained memory of DNA damage","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://genesdev.cshlp.org/lookup/doi/10.1101/gad.1994911","volume":"25"},
