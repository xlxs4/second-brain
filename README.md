To whoever might find this useful, I did a thing. This is a distilled look into the core of what I've gathered and ended up at after a ton of thinking and browsing, and it's how I intend to organize my life going forward. Besides the notebook, everything else will happen in a single [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault. Because this is me [writing things for myself by default, disregarding the audience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J) this won't make much sense. If you want it to make more sense, start with the resources section first. I want to base most of my shit on *sketchnoting*, hopefully accumulating a vocabulary of atomic, small drawings that I can use in a modular fashion. If you want an even more structured way to make sense of all of this, I recommend you start with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJMP6fg_eIQ) and then [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWcHBmJLvLc) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i4CiImIYYA)

### General

- notes/drawings/icons should be atomic and modular
- [work with the garage door up](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu)
- [anti-marketing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS)
- [write things for yourself by default, disregarding the audience](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z8AfCaQJdp852orumhXPxHb3r278FHA9xZN8J)
- adopt the mindset of a curator – objective, opinionated, and reflective; in a deliberate way
- keep only what resonates; focus on actionability and relevance to projects
- few notes (2-6) per day: Does it inspire me? Is it personal? Is it suprising? Is it useful?
- be opportunistic, don't create things in advance, further compress things and refine them only when needed
- keep things off the working memory -> magic number of 4
  - don't have more than four nested subdirs
- try to use as few sources as possible
- don't need to organize unless I do: "Let chaos reign, then rein in chaos" - Andy Grove
  - don't try to figure out the system first
  - keep the organization, thinking, etc. to a minimum. Strive for bare minimum, don't complicate things
  - prioritize minimum friction
  - separate proccesses (e.g. separate capturing from organizing)
  - don't need to use a lot of (app) features
- everything should ideally be a remix; minimize new research. Mix and match instead
  - build different things from the same blocks
- package things for your future self
- share frequently, get as much feedback as possible; at every step along the way

### Main Techniques

**PARA**:

- **P**rojects: a series of tasks linked to a goal, with a deadline
  "In which project will this be most useful?" -> things I'm working at right now
- **A**reas: *If none*, a sphere of activity with a standard to be maintained over time
  "in which area will this be most useful?" -> long-term commitments, that don't have a due date
- **R**esources: *If none*, topic or theme of ongoing interest
  "Which resource does this belong to?" -> resources I want to reference in the future
- **A**rchives: *If none*, inactive items from the other three categories
  things I've completed or am no longer working on (review is important for this)

- don't organize by source, organize by actionability: "where will I use this info?"
- organize for project, not by topic

- every now and then, as part of a Review, put the Project list side-by-side with a Goal list and draw lines to match

- The important distinction between Projects and Areas is the deadline
- Projects *always* fall into Areas
- A task can belong to no Project but to an Area

**CODE**:

- **C**ollect
- **O**rganize
- **D**istill
- **E**xpress

- Collect should be *separate* from Organize. Don't have the mental burden on where to put the things you capture, just capture them
  - Organize should happen *opportunisticly*, only when you want to *use* the information

- Work towards defining favorite problems like Feynman's 12 favorite problems

---

- I need to be able to take a note 24/7 -> physical notebook
- have a place for the rough notes as I go
- have a place for the summaries
- ideally everything ends up in a drawing
  - when something has ended up in a drawing, should it be discarded?
- make excalidraw/note templates ta opoia exoun ta guides/tips on how to do this whole process
- weekly review
- tags not really needed, I can just search stuff

---

- process to sketchnote book/paper:
  1. bread+notes (**Collect**)
  2. single-page chapter summary (rough, just for me (working with the garage door up)) (**Organize**)
  3. highlight actionable ideas, what can I do with these ideas from the summary? (what's next?, followup ideas) (**Distill**)
  4. single-page summary (overall structure? essential details?)/book-on-a-page (**Express**)
    - find an image from flaticon for each note you want to include, paste them in the excalidraw drawing
    - you can also draw things directly in excalidraw, minimal drawings
    - download each image and save in an assets folder in the vault, you can directly draw from this (can suffix with XYZ icon)
    - add the things you draw in excalidraw libraries
    - do some search for premade excalidraw libraries
    - use emojis (?)
    - instead of trying to do everything at once, do separate drawings for each chapter, then combine
    - you can have a subdir for the notes, work there, add the images there, and then a separate subdir for the book-on-a-page
    - you can open a pane as a popup, to work and copy the images side-by-side
